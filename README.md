LEMRIO Seminar
==============

This talk is to give an overview of the background and application of
economic data for understanding the anthropocence.

# Fri Oct  2 17:57:15 EDT 2020

- Humans = dominant global impact -> Anthropocene
- The far reach of the city
- Complex systems = many players and indirect effects matter
- How do we quantify and manage systems?
- A new equation for a new era in science
- Work = Forest Land Embodied in Trade
- Analysis = Structure = Robustness
- Next up = Climate change impacts and global scale

# Overview

 <!-- Who cares -->


- Ecological studies are now embeded in the anthropocene
- Interconnected world
- Global environmental change
- Complex systems at global scales

# Background

- Indirect effects
- Economic trade data is a window into human impacts
- Input-Output Analysis provides a modeling framework 
- Ecological network theory provides predictions and metrics 
- Systems theory provides strategies for inteventions

# Input-Output Analysis: The Short Short Version

- Leontief

# IO Analysis and Ecology

- ENA <- Odums, MacArthur, Ulanowicz, Patten,
- SNA -> ecological networks (Watts and Strogatz, etc.)
- Structure linked to function (Donella Meadows)

# Environmentally Extended IO Networks

- Allows for indirect/consumption based accounting

# Current Research

- China -> Main output of IO studies (TreeMap of Bib)
- Production and consumption accounting

# A Brief History of Forest Time in China

- China is big and diverse
- Long history of human habitation in China
- Historically, two primary regions of forestry
- Forest conservation impacts harvest
- Flows within China and among countries globally important

# Main Research Questions:

1. What research has been done on forest or forest landscape embodied
networks?
2. What is the network structure? How can we characterize it?
3. What can we say about the potential stability/resilience of the
network?

Input-Output Models

Input-Output Modeling

X = (I − A)−1 Y

Input-Output Modeling

• Uses a simple subtraction to calculate
all of the indirect consumption
correctly
X = (I − A)−1 Y

Input-Output Modeling

X = (I − A)−1 Y

• Uses a simple subtraction to calculate
all of the indirect consumption
correctly
• Indirect effects can, and usually are,
greater than direct

Input-Output Modeling

X = (I − A)−1 Y

• Uses a simple subtraction to calculate
all of the indirect consumption
correctly
• Indirect effects can, and usually are,
greater than direct
• Has been influencial in ecosystem
network analysis

Environmental Extended Input-Output Models

X = (I − A)−1 Y

Environmental Extended Input-Output Models

X = E (I − A)−1 Y

Environmental Extended Input-Output Models

X = E (I − A)−1 Y

• Any environmental (or social) variable
can be used

Environmental Extended Input-Output Models

X = E (I − A)−1 Y

• Any environmental (or social) variable
can be used
• Required: estimate of how much is
used by each indusrial sector

• Global carbon emmisions are primarily indirect by developed country consumption
(23%) [5]

Conclusions

• Localization of resource consumption increases modularity
• This is line with recent observations of the benefits of empowering local
communities for forest restoration

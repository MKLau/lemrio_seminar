	abstract = {Cities are leading actions against climate change through global networks. More than 360 global cities announced during the 2015 Paris Climate Conference that the collective impact of their commitments will deliver over half of the world’s urban greenhouse gas emissions reductions by 2020. Previous studies on multi-city carbon footprint networks using sub-national, multi-region input-output (MRIO) modelling have identified additional opportunities for addressing the negative impacts of climate change through joint actions between cities within a country. However, similar links between city carbon footprints have not yet been studied across countries. In this study we focus on inter-city and inter-country carbon flows between two trading partners in a first attempt to address this gap. We construct a multi-scale, global MRIO model to describe a transnational city carbon footprint network among five Chinese megacities and the five largest Australian capital cities. First, we quantify city carbon footprints by sectors and regions. Based on the carbon map concept we show how local emissions reductions influence other regions’ carbon footprints. We then present a city emissions ’outsourcing hierarchy’ based on the balance of emissions embodied in intercity and international trade. The differences between cities and their position in the hierarchy emphasize the need for a bespoke treatment of their responsibilities towards climate change mitigation. Finally, we evaluate and discuss the potentially significant benefits of harmonising and aligning China’s carbon trading schemes with Australia’s cap and trade policy.},

	abstract = {The use of separate transport and economic models in urban planning provides a limited view of economic impacts, restricts the testing of network design options and lengthens the planning process. Furthermore, the standard methodology for economic appraisal assumes partial economic equilibrium and cannot determine the distribution of impacts from the transport sector to households. Computable general equilibrium (CGE) models can capture general equilibrium effects and measure welfare at the household level, but mostly lack integration with transport models and do not represent all trip generators. This paper develops an integrated traffic assignment and spatial CGE model in nonlinear complementarity form, casted as a framework for economic appraisal of urban transport projects. The CGE submodel generates commuting, shopping and leisure trips as inputs into the transport submodel, which then assigns trips to the network according to user equilibrium. The resulting travel times then feed back into household prices and freight margins. Households and firms fully account for travel times in decisions on where to shop, how much labour to supply and where to source production inputs. Calibration and applications of the model are demonstrated for 14 regions and 2 industries across Sydney using GAMS/PATH on the NEOS server. The welfare of various network improvements is measured using equivalent variations. The model can be calibrated to external strategic transport models, and be extended to simulate additional trip generators and land-use.},

	abstract = {In the search for benefits to justify transport projects, economic appraisals have increasingly incorporated the valuation of impacts to the wider economy. Computable general equilibrium (CGE) models provide a framework to estimate these impacts by simulating the interactions of urban economies and transport networks. In CGE models, households and firms are represented by microeconomic behavioral functions, and markets adjust according to prices. As markets both inside and outside the transport network are taken into account, a wide variety of measures that can assist in economic appraisals can be extracted. However, urban CGE models are computationally burdensome and require detailed, spatially disaggregate data. This paper discusses the methodology used to develop a database, including an input–output table, for the calibration of an urban CGE model for Sydney, Australia. Official and publicly available data sources were manipulated by using a number of mathematical and statistical techniques to compile a table for 249 regions and 20 sectors across Sydney. Issues, such as determining the appropriate level of aggregation, generating incomplete data, and managing conflicting data, that other input–output table developers may encounter when constructing multiregional tables were addressed in the study. The table entries themselves were mapped and explored, as they provide a useful study of the spatial economy of Sydney. Future work will focus on streamlining the construction of input–output tables and incorporating new data sources.},

Presentation and poster abstracts were reviewed against the following criteria: * Clarity: the thought/expression/concept should be reasonable and comprehensible. * Scientific approach: including definition of the problem, hypothesis, methodology, application, results, and analysis. * Practice of Forestry: should bridge the gap between science and decisionmaking in the field of forest management. * Originality: should report preliminary or novel results on limited data sets or applications of existing methodologies to new areas. * Contemporary Topics: relevant to the convention theme and track themes that will appeal to a large number of attendees and contribute to professional development. * Policy: local, regional, national, or international policy or program analysis using quantitative or qualitative data analysis.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have shown that the high standard of living enjoyed by people in the richest countries often comes at the expense of CO2 emissions produced with technologies of low efficiency in less affluent,  developing countries. Less apparent is that this relationship between developed and developing can exist within a single country's borders, with rich regions consuming and exporting high-value goods and services  that depend upon production of low-cost and emission-intensive goods and services from poorer regions in the same country. As the world's largest emitter of CO2, China is a prominent and important example, struggling to balance rapid economic growth and environmental sustainability across provinces that are in very different stages of development. In this study, we track CO2 emissions embodied in products traded among Chinese provinces and internationally. We find that 57\% of China's emissions are related to goods  that are consumed outside of the province where they are produced. For instance, up to 80\% of the emissions related to goods consumed in the highly developed coastal provinces are imported from less developed provinces in central and western China where many low-value-added but high-carbon-intensive goods are produced. Without policy attention to this sort of interprovincial carbon leakage, the less developed provinces will struggle to meet their emissions intensity targets, whereas the more developed provinces might achieve their own targets by further outsourcing. Consumption-based accounting of emissions can thus inform effective and equitable climate policy within China.}

It will examine the regional trends and dimensions of the mitigation challenge. It will also analyze what role regional initiatives, both with a focus on climate change and in other domains such as trade, can play in addressing these mitigation challenges. 

The regional dimension of mitigation was not explicitly addressed in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). Its discussion of policies, instruments, and cooperative agreements (Working Group III AR4, Chapter 13) was focused primarily on the global and national level. However, mitigation challenges and opportunities differ significantly by region. This is particularly the case for the interaction between development / growth opportunities and mitigation policies, which are closely linked to resource endowments, the level of economic development, patterns of urbanization and industrialization, access to finance and technology, and - more broadly - the capacity to develop and implement various mitigation options. There are also modes of regional cooperation, ranging from regional initiatives focused specifically on climate change (such as the emissions trading scheme (ETS) of the European Union (EU)) to other forms of cooperation in the areas of trade, energy, or infrastructure, that could potentially provide a platform for delivering and implementing mitigation policies. These dimensions will be examined in this chapter. 

Specifically, this chapter will address the following questions: 

-  Why is the regional level important for analyzing and achieving mitigation objectives? 

- What are the trends, challenges, and policy options for mitigation in different regions? 

- To what extent are there promising opportunities, existing examples, and barriers for leapfrogging in technologies and development strategies to low-carbon development paths for different regions? 

- What are the interlinkages between mitigation and adaptation at the regional level? 

- To what extent can regional initiatives and regional integration and cooperation promote an agenda of low-carbon climate-resilient development? What has been the record of such initiatives, and what are the barriers? Can they serve as a platform for further mitigation activities?}

The Haihe River Basin (HRB) is an extremely water stressed hydrological system, which encompasses the two megacities of Beijing and Tianjin, and is experiencing the detrimental impacts of the recent unprecedented economic growth on its scarce water resources. We applied an integrated multi-regional input-output (MRIO) hydro-economic model combined with the water scarcity index to analyze consumption water footprint (WF) and embedded or virtual water  flows in inter-regional trade in the HRB and their impacts on hydrosystems (scarcity water footprint).  The study shows that in 2007, the WF of the HRB was  approximately 37.1 billion m{\^{ }}3 (277 m{\^{ }}3 per capita), of which the 'scarcity' WF was approximately 26.7 billion m{\^{ }}3 or 72\% of the total WF. In line with its high level of water  scarcity, the HRB's net import level of virtual water was 11.3 billion m{\^{ }}3 (84 m{\^{ }}3 per capita), with the total import of 25.9 billion m{\^{ }}3 and total export of 14.6 billion m{\^{ }}3. In contrast, the HRB's net import level of virtual scarce water is at a relatively moderate scale of .8 billion m{\^{ }}3, with the import of 15.7 billion m{\^{ }}3 and export of 13.9 billion m{\^{ }}3. While it is highly desirable to import more virtual water from water rich regions, a caution is  needed in importing virtual scarce water because the latter will lead to greater water stress in other water scarce regions. Accounting for water scarcity in the WF  analysis increases the effectiveness of the analysis and generates more valuable and accurate informaion for water management and planning.}

In this paper, we set up a multi-regional input-output (MRIO) model to analyze the transferring routes of TSPM emissions between urban ecosystem and surrounding regions through trades. TSPM emission from particulate source regions and sectors are identified by analyzing the embodied TSPM flows through inter-regional trade. The track of TSPM from origin to end via consumption activities is also revealed by tracing the product supply chain associated with the TSPM emissions. Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (Jing-Jin-Ji) as the most industrialized district of China is selected for a case study. The result shows that over 70\% of TSPM emissions associated with goods consumed in Beijing and Tianjin occurred outside of their own administrative boundaries, implying that Beijing and Tianjin are net TSPM exporters. Meanwhile, 63\% of the total TSPM emissions in Hebei province are resulted from the outside demand, indicating Hebei is a net importer. In addition, nearly half of TSPM emissions are the by-products related to electricity and heating supply and non-metal mineral production in Jing-Jin-Ji district. Based on the modeling results, we provided new insights into establishing systemic strategies and identifying mitigation priorities to stem TSPM emissions in urban ecosystem and its surrounding areas.}

The implementaton of resilient energy systems requires  a quantitative understanding of the socio-economic practices underlying such systems. Specifically, in line with the increasing globalization of trade, there remains a critical knowledge gap on the link between embodied energy in the production and consumption of trade goods. To bridge this knowledge gap, we investigate the resilience of global energy systems through an examination of  diversity measure of global embodied  electricity trade based on multi-regional input-output (MRIO) networks. The significance of this reserch lies in its ability to utilize high resolution MRIO data sets in assessing the resilience of national energy systems. This research indicates that secure and responsible consumption requires the diversification of not only energy generation but also energy imports. This research will lay the ground for further research in the governance of resilience in global energy networks.}

However, the factors driving the decline have not been  quantitatively evaluated; the role of natural gas in the decline therefore remains speculative. Here  we analyse the factors affecting US emissions from 1997 to 2013. Before 2007, rising emissions  were primarily driven by economic growth. After 2007, decreasing emissions were largely a result  of economic recession with changes in fuel mix (for example, substitution of natural gas for coal)  playing a comparatively minor role. Energy-climate policies may, therefore, be necessary to  lock-in the recent emissions reductions and drive further decarbonization of the energy system  as the US economy recovers and grows.}

As production takes place in supply chains,increasingly extending over  several countries, there are various options available in which emissions originating from one and the same activity may be attributed to different agents along the supply chain and thus to different countries. In this way, several distinct types of national carbon accounts can be constructed. We  argue that these accounts will typically differ in the information they provide to individual countries on the effects their actions have on global emissions; and they may also, to varying degrees, prove useful in supporting the pursuit of an effective and just climate policy. None of the  accounting systems, however, prove 'best' in achieving these aims under real-world circumstances; we thus suggest compiling reliable data to aid in the consistent calculation of multiple carbon accounts on a global level.}

	abstract = {Rapid economic growth and urbanization in China have led to a substantial change in consumption patterns and diet structure of Chinese consumers over the past few decades. A growing demand for feed, fuel, and fiber also places intense pressure on land resources. With continuing growth of China's economy and migration from rural to urban, the increase in food consumption and change in diet structure will likely continue, which will not only impose pressure on domestic land resources, but also exert impact on land resources in other countries through import. This article applies a global multiregion input-output (MRIO) model to trace agricultural land use along global supply chains and examines the impact of China's future food consumption on global land use in 2030 against different socioeconomic and technological scenarios. Our scenarios show that by 2030, China would need an additional 21\% of cropland to support its increasing food demand, driven by population growth, urbanization, and income growth and the associated diet structure change. Almost one third of cropland associated with household consumption (34 million hectares [Mha]) will be "outsourced" to foreign countries, such as Argentina, Brazil, the United States, and Thailand, for the consumption of cereal grains, soybeans, and paddy rice. China also consumes 2.4 Mha of cropland from Africa for its consumption of cereal grains and oil seeds. The dependence of domestic consumption on significant amounts of foreign cropland shows that China would face serious challenges to meet its grain self-sufficiency policy in the future, and, at the same time, this dependence would contribute to environmental and food security problems elsewhere.}

We employ Multi-regional Input-Output analysis to distinguish between sulfur-dioxide (SO2) emissions produced within a country's boarders (production-based emissions) and emissions triggered by consumption in other countries (consumption-based emissions). We use social network analysis to capture countries' level of integration within the global trade network. We then apply the Prais-Winsten panel estimation technique to a panel data set across 172 countries over20 years (1990.2010) to estimate the relationships between countries' level of integration and SO2 emissions, and the impact of trade integration and SO2 emission on mortality rates. Our findings suggest a positive, (log-) linear relationship between a country's level of integration and both kinds of emissions. In addition, although more integrated countries are mainly responsible for both forms of emissions, our findings indicate that they also tend to experience lower mortality rates. Our approach offers a unique combination of social network analysis with multiregional input-output analysis, which better operationalizes intuitive concepts about global trade and trade structure}

Various approaches exist for quantifying the land embodied in international trade flows and consumption, i.e. the land footprint. These can be classified into a) environmental-economic accounting approaches, applying input-output analysis and tracking supply chains in monetary values, b) physical accounting approaches, using an accounting framework based on data for production, trade and utilization of agricultural and forestry commodities and tracking supply chains in physical units, and c) hybrid accounting, combining elements from both environmental-economic and physical accounting. The results of recent studies vary widely, indicating a lack of robustness and thus hampering their application in policy making.
This report provides an in-depth review of the current state of the art in measuring land footprints. We identify differences in available accounting methods and indicate their shortcomings, which are mainly attributable to the product and supply chain coverage and detail, and biases introduced by the use of monetary flows as a proxy for actual physical flows. We offer options and give clear recommendations for the further development of actual and virtual global biomass and land flow ac-counting methods, particularly highlighting the advantages of hybrid accounting approaches as a framework for the robust and transparent assessment of land footprints associated with global bio-mass flows.

Embodied energy is the energy consumed during all of these activities, both directly and indirectly. Multiregional input-output (MRIO) analysis can calculate the energy consumption embodied in flows among sectors for multiple cities or regions. Our goal was to address a problem apparent in previous research, which was insufficient attention to indirect energy flows. We combined MRIO analysis with ecological network analysis to calculate the embodied energy consumption and the energy-related carbon footprints of five sectors in three regions that comprise the Jing-Jin-Ji agglomeration, using data from 2002 and 2007. Our analysis traced metabolic processes of sectors from the perspective of final consumption. Based on the embodied energy analysis, we quantified the indirect energy consumption implied in exchanges of sectors and its distribution and identified the relationships formed through the indirect consumption to analyze the roles of providers and receivers in the system. Results showed that the embodied energy consumption for the Jing-Jin-Ji region increased from 2002 to 2007 as a result of increased energy consumption in Tianjin and Hebei. Overall, consumption of Beijing decreased likely attributable to the fact that government policies relocated industries during this time in anticipation of the Olympic Games. The relationships among sectors changed: Beijing changed from a net exporter to an importer, whereas Hebei changed from a net importer of energy from Beijing to an exporter to Beijing, and Tianjin served as an importer in both years.}

	abstract = {Population and economic growth pose unique challenges in securing sufficient water, energy, and food to meet demand at the sub-national (regional), national, and supra-national level. An increasing share of this demand is met through trade and imports. The unprecedented rapid growth, extent, and complexity of global value chains (GVCs) since the 1980s have reshaped global trade. The GVCs ? and new economic patterns of regionalization ? affect the demands on water, energy, and food within countries and across global supply chains. East Asia is of particular interest due to the region?s rapid economic growth, substantial population size, high interdependence of the region?s economies, and varying degree of resource availability. While greater interdependence across the region has increased the efficiency of production and trade, these activities require the input of water-energy-food and generate disturbances in the environment. The transnational inter-regional input-output approach is utilized in a tele-connected Water-Energy-Food Nexus (WEFN) analysis of the East Asia GVC to assess competing demands for these resources and environmental outcomes.

This analysis demonstrates the hidden virtual flows of water, energy, and food embodied in intra-regional and transnational inter-regional trade. China?s current national export oriented economic growth strategy in East Asia is not sustainable from the WEFN perspective. China is a net virtual exporter of nexus resources to Japan and South Korea. China?s prioritization of economic growth and trade in low value added and pollution intensive sectors consumes a great amount of nexus resources within its territory to satisfy consumers? demands in Japan and South Korea. Japan?s Kanto and Kinki regions and South Korea?s Sudokwon region were the major beneficiaries while China bore the environmental burden associated with the production of exports. For example, net virtual exports from China?s East region included over 1.2 billion m3 of scarce water and 61.3 million metric (CO2 equivalent) tons of greenhouse gases (i.e. CO2, NH4, and N2O) and 2 million metric tons of SOx emissions.

Trade is an important mechanism for overcoming resource bottlenecks, but, taking into account environmental linkages, regional specialization is not necessarily mutually beneficial. This analysis demonstrates a mismatch between regional water-energy-food availability and final resource consumption and the lack of attention for environmental impacts in national economic growth strategies. Resource scarce countries like China must, therefore, incorporate trade-off decisions between pursuing national economic growth, incurring environmental degradation, and food security into strategic regional development policies.}

Towards this end, using a multi-regional input-output model (MRIO), this research quantifies the domestic COD footprints (CODF) for individual regions and their interactions in 2010. Our results reveal that China?s COD discharges were primarily from the agricultural sector, with a secondary contribution from the household sector. Of the 30 provinces studied, some eastern coastal provinces with large CODF, e.g., Shanghai, Tianjin and Jiangsu, were net interregional importers. The CODF per capita for the studied regions varied based on the final demand, lifestyle affluence, and availability of pollution-treatment infrastructure. The virtual COD flow patterns were divided into agricultural and industrial discharge, whereby the former flow transfers crossed long distances between the western and eastern regions of China. A comparison of the regional COD flows and their water resources characteristics suggests that Chinese policymakers should design and implement a holistic national plan to reduce the country?s total COD discharge based on supply- and demand-side responsibilities ? especially in net exporter regions that lack fresh water. Furthermore, a reduction in the demand for pollution-intensive products and an increase in the demand-side reuse and recycling of resources is vital.}

	abstract = {Footprint analysis reveals the appropriation of land resources from a consumer?s perspective. We here present a novel hybrid land-flow accounting method for the calculation of land footprints, employing a globally consistent top-down approach and combining physical with environmental economic accounting. Physical accounting tracks food products from ?field to plate? and non-food from ?field to industrial use? using the large harmonized FAO data to track biomass flows and related land use in physical volumes (tons of biomass). Environmental-economic accounting is used to further track non-food commodities in monetary values to final consumption. The hybrid methodology has been applied annually between 1995 and 2010 for 21 regional markets globally and including major economies separately (e.g. USA, China, India). Per capita extents and composition of cropland footprints vary widely across the world. Detailed results for Germany and the EU28 highlight the higher land demand of livestock-based diets compared to crop-based diets, the growing integration in international markets, and the growing importance of the non-food sector since 2000. Today the land footprint of each Germany citizen appropriates on average 2693 m2 cropland (about one half for livestock-based diets, one quarter for crop-based diets and one quarter for non-food products). Additional 1655 m2 of grassland per capita are used for the consumption of ruminant livestock products. Germany is a major and increasing trading partner with current net ?cropland imports? of 10.6 Mha. Overall, half of Germany?s 22 Mha cropland footprint relies on domestic cultivation and half on land resources abroad. Albeit large uncertainties in the calculation of grassland footprints, results point towards Germany being a significant net importer of grassland embedded in ruminant livestock products.}

	abstract = {The global trade of biomass-based products leads to an increasing regional decoupling of the area of production and consumption. Area-based land footprint calculations attribute the extents of land use required to prevailing national consumption patterns. Another report (Fischer et al., 2016) of the present study describes the methodology for the calculation of area-based footprints and presents results for Germany and the EU. Beyond area extents, additional information is needed to assess the sustainability of land use, requiring further analyses regarding environmental impacts and preservation of land quality and ecosystem services. This report discusses extensions of area-based land footprints with meaningful impact-oriented indicators for the assessment of the effects of different consumption patterns on the ecosystems and sustainability of land use.
 First, existing indicators for representing the environmental impacts of land use are introduced in the context of their linkages and complementarity to area-based land footprints. The report discusses the following key indicators, which were identified as particularly relevant during an export workshop: System indicators, which qualify the area-based footprints across globally very different potential land productivities,deforestation footprint, energy use in agriculture, and irrigation water use in agriculture classified by degree of water scarcity. We introduce the methods developed for the quantification of system indicators for cropland and grassland footprints and for the deforestation footprint, and present results for Germany and the EU.}

	abstract = {Robust land footprint indicators can potentially extend the consumption-based resource use indicator of the German sustainability strategy, which focuses on abiotic resources including fossil fuels, metals, and construction and industrial minerals and decidedly excludes biotic resources. 
Various approaches exist for quantifying the land embodied in international trade flows and consumption, i.e. the land footprint. These can be classified into a) environmental-economic accounting approaches, applying input-output analysis and tracking supply chains in monetary values, b) physical accounting approaches, using an accounting framework based on data for production, trade and utilization of agricultural and forestry commodities and tracking supply chains in physical units, and c) hybrid accounting, combining elements from both environmental-economic and physical accounting. The results of recent studies vary widely, indicating a lack of robustness and thus hampering their application in policy making. 
This report provides an in-depth review of the current state of the art in measuring land footprints. We identify differences in available accounting methods and indicate their shortcomings, which are mainly attributable to the product and supply chain coverage and detail, and biases introduced by the use of monetary flows as a proxy for actual physical flows. We offer options and give clear recommendations for the further development of actual and virtual global biomass and land flow accounting methods, particularly highlighting the advantages of hybrid accounting approaches as a framework for the robust and transparent assessment of land footprints associated with global biomass flows.}

These indicators should provide an improved understanding of the global teleconnections of consumption and land use relevant for policy making towards achieving sustainable land use. 
This synthesis report presents the key results from this project. First, we present a structured overview of existing approaches for estimating land footprintsand describe their technical and structural characteristicsas well as their strengths and weaknesses. This leads to the specification of a hybrid methodology as the preferred calculation approach. In the second part, we present the developed innovative hybrid land footprint method, consisting of a global land flow accounting and trade model capturing commodity flows in physical units to track embodied land along global supply chains. For non-food commodities the supply chains were complemented by an environmental input-output model. This method was used to calculate the cropland, grassland and forestland footprint of Germany and the EU. Finally, an overview of existing indicator systems for representing the environmental impacts of land use was provided and their complementary usage to extend area-based land footprints was discussed. A few of these complementary indicators were also quantified, most notably the deforestation footprint. The synthesis report closes with an overview of the thematic areas that need to be addressed in future research.}

This uncertainty arises primarily from inconsistencies between national accounts and household surveys and, to a smaller extent, from using aggregated sectors. Researchers may introduce significant inaccuracies by ignoring these inconsistencies when reporting household footprints. We apply the methodology to India and Brazil, where we find the size of this uncertainty to be higher than 20\% of footprints at most income levels. We expect that previous estimates for these countries may have been overestimated due to these inconsistencies. Other knowledge gaps, such as inaccuracies in multiregional input-output tables and household surveys, add further uncertainty beyond our estimates.}

	abstract = {Brazil plays a major role in the global biofuel economy as the world's second largest producer and consumer and the largest exporter of ethanol. Its demand is expected to significantly increase in coming years, largely driven by national and international carbon mitigation targets. However, biofuel crops require significant amounts of water and land resources that could otherwise be used for the production of food, urban water supply, or energy generation. Given Brazil's uneven spatial distribution of water resources among regions, a potential expansion of ethanol production will need to take into account regional or local water availability, as an increased water demand for irrigation would put further pressure on already water-scarce regions and compete with other users. By applying an environmentally extended multiregional input-output (MRIO) approach, we uncover the scarce water footprint and the interregional virtual water flows associated with sugarcane-derived biofuel production driven by domestic final consumption and international exports in 27 states in Brazil. Our results show that bio-ethanol is responsible for about one third of the total sugarcane water footprint besides sugar and other processed food production. We found that richer states such as S{\~a}o Paulo benefit by accruing a higher share of economic value added from exporting ethanol as part of global value chains while increasing water stress in poorer states through interregional trade. We also found that, in comparison with other crops, sugarcane has a comparative advantage when rainfed while showing a comparative disadvantage as an irrigated crop; a tradeoff to be considered when planning irrigation infrastructure and bioethanol production expansion. {\copyright} 2017 by the authors.}

CO2emissions from fossil fuels and industry (EFF) are based on energy statistics andcement production data, respectively, while emissions from land-use change (ELUC), mainly deforestation, arebased on land-cover change data and bookkeeping models. The global atmospheric CO2concentration is mea-sured directly and its rate of growth (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The oceanCO2sink (SOCEAN) and terrestrial CO2sink (SLAND) are estimated with global process models constrained byobservations. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (BIM), the difference between the estimated total emis-sions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfectdata and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as{$\pm$}1{\ensuremath{\sigma}}. For the lastdecade available (2007?2016),EFFwas 9.4{$\pm$}0.5 GtC yr?1,ELUC1.3{$\pm$}0.7 GtC yr?1,GATM4.7{$\pm$}0.1 GtC yr?1,SOCEAN2.4{$\pm$}0.5 GtC yr?1, andSLAND3.0{$\pm$}0.8 GtC yr?1, with a budget imbalanceBIMof 0.6 GtC yr?1indi-cating overestimated emissions and/or underestimated sinks. For year 2016 alone, the growth inEFFwas ap-proximately zero and emissions remained at 9.9{$\pm$}0.5 GtC yr?1. Also for 2016,ELUCwas 1.3{$\pm$}0.7 GtC yr?1,GATMwas 6.1{$\pm$}0.2 GtC yr?1,SOCEANwas 2.6{$\pm$}0.5 GtC yr?1, andSLANDwas 2.7{$\pm$}1.0 GtC yr?1, with a smallBIMof?0.3 GtC.GATMcontinued to be higher in 2016 compared to the past decade (2007?2016), reflectingin part the high fossil emissions and the smallSLANDconsistent with El Ni{\~n}o conditions. The global atmo-spheric CO2concentration reached 402.8{$\pm$}0.1 ppm averaged over 2016. For 2017, preliminary data for the first6?9 months indicate a renewed growth inEFFof+2.0 \% (range of 0.8 to 3.0 \%) based on national emissionsprojections for China, USA, and India, and projections of gross domestic product (GDP) corrected for recentchanges in the carbon intensity of the economy for the rest of the world.

The derived products include, for example, biofuels, textiles, detergents or cosmetics. Given the far-reaching global implications of an expanding non-food bioeconomy, an assessment of the bioeconomy?s resource use from a footprint perspective is urgently needed. We determine the global cropland footprint of non-food products with a hybrid land flow accounting model combining data from the Food and Agriculture Organization and the multi-regional input-output model EXIOBASE. The globally interlinked model covers all cropland areas used for the production of crop- and animal-based non-food commodities for the years from 1995 to 2010. We analyse global patterns of raw material producers, processers and consumers of bio-based non-food products, with a particular focus on the European Union. Results illustrate that the EU is a major processer and the number one consumer region of non-food cropland, despite being only the fifth largest producing region. Two thirds of the cropland required to satisfy EU non-food consumption are located in other world regions, giving rise to a significant dependency on imported products and to potential impacts on distant ecosystems. With almost 29\% in 2010, oilseed production, used to produce, for example, biofuels, detergents and polymers, represents the dominant share in the EU?s non-food cropland footprint. There is also a significant contribution of more traditional non-food biomass uses such as fibre crops (for textiles) and animal hides and skins (for leather products). Our study emphasises the importance of comprehensively assessing the implications of the non-food bioeconomy expansion as envisaged in various policy strategies, such as the Bioeconomy Strategy of the European Commission.}

However, a significant increase in production of biofuels might potentially be realized at the expense of overusing natural resources, particularly land and water. Understanding the tradeoffs between the impacts on land and water arises as a critical issue in the development of biofuels. This energy-water-land nexus might be particularly important for Brazil, which currently is the world's second largest producer and the largest exporter of biofuels. Furthermore, Brazil itself has set up its own Intended Nationally Determined Contribution agenda with a significant growth of biofuel production (18\%) by 2030. Most studies on environmental impacts of biofuel production have either focused on land use or water use, but very few studies assessed both. Using an environmentally extended multiregional input-output (MRIO) approach, this study analyzes the current water-land nexus of bioenergy production in Brazil by quantifying the distribution of tradeoffs and synergies between land and water use for bioethanol production and its environmental consequences across Brazilian states. Our results show a clear tradeoff of water and land impacts and significant differences between irrigated and rainfed ethanol production. When including water and land scarcity in the analysis, the results are significantly different, uncovering very different tradeoffs and synergies between bioethanol producer and consumer states that could inform the expansion of bioenergy in Brazil. Compared to other crops, sugarcane has a higher comparative advantage relative to land than to water.}

Although observed trading patterns do often not support this hypothesis, there is a lack of research to explore the reasons why trade patterns often do not support the intuitive virtual water hypothesis. To fill this important gap, we introduce comparative advantage theory in a quantitative way to track the driving forces of net virtual water export based on the spatial-temporal distribution of resource productivity and opportunity costs of land, labor and water use in agricultural and non-agricultural sectors across Chinese provinces between 1995 and 2015. The results show that regional differences in land productivity between agricultural and non-agricultural sectors are the main forces determining the pattern of virtual water flows across major regions, and other resources such as labor and water have played only a limited role. Our study shows that the current market forces reflect the scarcity of land resources, but does not reflect the water scarcity in the context of interregional trade in China. Our findings suggest that the ongoing efforts to increase land productivity of agriculture in the southern regions would contribute to reducing water scarcity in the North and Northeast China Plain.}

The expanding non-food bioeconomy can have far-reaching social and ecological implications; yet, the non-food sector has attained little attention in land footprint studies. This paper provides the first assessment of the global cropland footprint of non-food products of the European Union (EU), a globally important region regarding its expanding bio-based economy. We apply a novel hybrid land flow accounting model, combining the biophysical trade model LANDFLOW with the multi-regional input-output model EXIOBASE. The developed hybrid approach improves the level of product and country detail, while comprehensively covering all global supply chains from agricultural production to final consumption, including highly-processed products, such as many non-food products. The results highlight the EU's role as a major processing and the biggest consuming region of cropland-based non-food products while at the same time relying heavily on imports. Two thirds of the cropland required to satisfy the EU's non-food biomass consumption are located in other world regions, particularly in China, the US and Indonesia, giving rise to potential impacts on distant ecosystems. With almost 39\% in 2010, oilseeds used to produce for example biofuels, detergents and polymers represented the dominant share of the EU's non-food cropland demand. Traditional non-food biomass uses, such as fibre crops for textiles and animal hides and skins for leather products, also contributed notably (22\%).

The results show regressive distributional effects of carbon pricing across provinces, i.e. poor provinces are affected more by the price. Carbon pricing also shows rural-urban regressivity (i.e. rural households are impacted more heavily than urban households) in more than half of the provinces. Within each selected province, carbon pricing has mostly regressive effects, i.e. poorer households groups are affected more than richer groups for urban households in all provinces and for rural houeholds in one third of the provinces. When looking more specifically at direct energy consumption, we find that the carbon pricing on domestic fuels generally shows regressivity, while pricing carbon on transport fuels shows progressivity. In addition, the impact of carbon pricing on residence (mainly on electricity and coal) is the most important contributor to the regional regressivity across provinces.}

Our results show that the reduction in primary PM2.5 and secondary precursor emissions in the target regions comes at the cost of increasing emissions especially in neighboring provinces. Similarly, co-benefits of lower CO2 emissions and reduced water consumption in the target region are achieved at the expense of higher impacts elsewhere, through outsourcing production to less developed regions in China.}

	abstract = {Air pollution presents a serious public health risk globally, particularly in fast industrializing countries such as China. Effectiveness of local air pollution control measures is influenced by external forces such as atmospheric emission transport and interprovincial trade. However, there is lack of research on comparison of these two indicators and local indicators (e.g. per capita income and emissions) determines the responsibility allocation in pollution control. In this paper, cross-provincial air pollution is stimulated via atmospheric transport (atmospheric linkage indicator) based on Weather Research and Forecasting/Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (WRF/CAMx) model. The air pollutants embodied in interprovincial trade (trade linkage indicator) was studied by using the latest multi-regional input-output (MRIO) model. This study revealed the significant influence of atmospheric transport on neighboring provinces. However, transport of trade-induced embodied emissions affects both neighboring areas and larger areas. According to aggregation analysis of these two indicators, in most provinces of China, direction of atmospheric transport contradicts to that of the trade-induced transport. These findings are used to analyze the rationality of regional differences in environmental tax rate in the new environmental protection tax law of China. By comparing the local and interregional linkage indicators, we found the current environment tax for air pollutants was mainly affected by per capita income whereas other environment and linkage indicators show little correlation. Therefore, we integrated environment and linkage indicators to propose adjusted provincial environment tax rates plan for air pollutants as a cost sharing mechanism. The results of this paper provide novel perspective for central government to adjust fairness environmental responsibility between provinces of China by tax policy.}

	abstract = {In order to combat environmental pollution, China enacted the Environmental Protection Tax Law in early 2018. Yet the impacts of the environmental tax on individual regions with different socioeconomic statuses, which are crucial for social justice and public acceptance, remain unclear. Based on a Multi-Regional Input-Output (MRIO) Table and a nationally regulated tax payment calculation method, this study analyzes the distributional impacts of the environmental tax due to each province?s consumption from both inter-provincial and rural-urban aspects. The national tax revenue based on the current levy mechanism is estimated to be only one seventh of the economic loss from premature mortality caused by ambient particulate matter (PM2.5). The taxation may slightly alleviate urban-rural inequality but may not be helpful with reducing inter-provincial inequality. We further analyze two alternative levy mechanisms. If each province imposes taxes to products it consumes (rather than produces, as in the current mechanism), with the tax rate linearly dependent on its per capita consumption expenditure, this would moderately increase the national tax revenue and effectively reduce inter-provincial inequality. To better compensate for the economic cost of air pollution and reduce regional inequality, it would be beneficial to increase the tax rate nationwide and implement a levy mechanism based on provincially differentiated levels of consumption and economic status.}

This question gains importance with climate change, because global scenarios of climate stabilization assume strong reductions in energy demand growth in developing countries. Here, we estimate bottom-up the energy embodied in the material underpinnings of decent living standards for India, Brazil and South Africa. We find that our estimates fall within these countries? energy demand projections in global scenarios of climate stabilization at 2 ?C, but to different extents. Further, national policies that encourage public transportation and sustainable housing construction will be critical to reduce these energy needs. The results of this study offer a benchmark to compare countries? mitigation efforts and technology transfer arrangements to assess the extent to which they address development priorities in an equitable manner.}

Here, we develop an approach to interpret carbon footprints of cities by focusing on their system boundaries, double counting recognition, spatial paths and policy sensitivities. Using four megacities in China as a case study, we quantify and map urban carbon footprints from various accounting perspectives: territorial carbon emissions, community-wide infrastructure carbon footprint, consumption-based carbon footprint, wider production carbon footprint, and full-scope carbon footprint. We find that the megacities? infrastructure carbon footprints are dominated by electricity-related emissions, whereas their consumption-based carbon footprints are significantly impacted by imports of both electricity and other products and services. Over 55\% of the full-scope carbon footprints (sums of all three scopes) of Beijing and Shanghai can be attributed to upstream emissions, while in Chongqing and Tianjin territorial emissions are more important. Key urban infrastructure contributes over 70\% to the total carbon emissions in import supply chains, determining the spatial paths and the carbon intensities of imports for these megacities. The main destinations of outsourced carbon emissions across the country from the megacities are found to be similar due to market domination of bulk suppliers of infrastructure-related and other carbon-intensive products. In addition, double counting of certain footprint indicators is considered small in this case, but could be amplified with increasing number of cities being assessed.}

	abstract = {Harvested biomass is linked to final consumption by networks of processes and actors that convert and distribute food and nonfood goods. Achieving a sustainable resource metabolism of the economy is an overarching challenge which manifests itself in a number of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Modeling the physical dimensions of biomass conversion and distribution networks is essential to understanding the characteristics, drivers, and dynamics of the socio-economic biomass metabolism. In this paper, we present the Food and Agriculture Biomass Input?Output model (FABIO), a set of multiregional supply, use and input?output tables in physical units, that document the complex flows of agricultural and food products in the global economy. The model assembles FAOSTAT statistics reporting crop production, trade, and utilization in physical units, supplemented by data on technical and metabolic conversion efficiencies, into a consistent, balanced, input?output framework. FABIO covers 191 countries and 130 agriculture, food and forestry products from 1986 to 2013. The physical supply use tables offered by FABIO provide a comprehensive, transparent, and flexible structure for organizing data representing flows of materials within metabolic networks. They allow tracing of biomass flows and embodied environmental pressures along global supply chains at an unprecedented level of product and country detail and can help to answer a range of questions regarding environment, agriculture, and trade. Here we apply FABIO to the case of cropland footprints and show the evolution of consumption-based cropland demand in China, the E.U., and the U.S.A. for plant-based and livestock-based food and nonfood products.}

	abstract = {High-income countries often outsource material demands to poorer countries along with the associated environmental damage. This phenomenon can also occur within (large) countries, such as China, which was responsible for 24 to 30\% of the global material footprint (MF) between 2007 and 2010. Understanding the distribution and development of China?s MF is hence critical for resource efficiency and circular economy ambitions globally. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of China?s MF at the provincial and sectoral levels. We combine provincial-level input?output data with sector- and province-specific trade data, detailed material extraction data, and the global input?output database EXIOBASE. We find that some provinces have MFs equivalent to medium-sized, high-income countries and limited evidence of material decoupling. Lower-income regions with high levels of material extraction can have an MF per capita as large as developed provinces due to much higher material intensities. The higher-income south-coastal provinces have lower MF per capita than equally developed provinces. This finding relates partly to differences in economic structure but indicates the potential for improvement across provinces. Investment via capital formation is up to 4 times more resource-intensive than consumption and drives 49 to 86\% of provincial-level MFs (the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average is 37\%). Resource-efficient production, efficient use of capital goods/infrastructure, and circular design are essential for reductions in China?s MF. Policy efforts to shift to a high-quality development model may reduce material intensities, preferably while avoiding the further outsourcing of high-intensity activities to other provinces or lower-income countries.}

	abstract = {Energy demand in global climate scenarios is typically derived for sectors ? such as buildings, transportation, and industry ? rather than from underlying services that could drive energy use in all sectors. This limits the potential to model household consumption and lifestyles as mitigation options through their impact on economy-wide energy demand. We present a framework to estimate the economy-wide energy requirements and carbon emissions associated with future household consumption, by linking Industrial Ecology tools and Integrated Assessment Models (IAM). We apply the framework to assess final energy and emission pathways for meeting three essential and energy-intensive dimensions of basic well-being in India: food, housing and mobility. We show, for example, that nutrition-enhancing dietary changes can reduce emissions by a similar amount as meeting future basic mobility in Indian cities with public transportation. The relative impact of energy demand reduction measures compared to decarbonization differs across these services, with housing having the lowest and food the highest. This framework provides complementary insights to those obtained from IAM by considering a broader set of consumption and well-being-related interventions, and illustrating trade-offs between demand and supply-side options in climate stabilization scenarios.}

The role of system approaches, models and accompanying decision support systems becomes of critical importance for managing catastrophic risks. The paper discusses some methodological challenges concerning the design of such models and decision support systems.}

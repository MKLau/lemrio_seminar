Far Flung Forest Landscapes in the Anthropocene
Context

1. Land-use changes = conversion
2. One proposal is it started about 1950 with acceleration
3. Biodiversity changes = species introductions and extinctions

This is why they’re called input-output tables
Each region has a set of sectors/industries
They can receive inputs from within a region
They can also recieve input from another region (aka. imports)
Final use = Consumption not used to produce another product

Global Trade Networks of Forest Landscapes

1. China’s imports have been increasing over time
2. Mostly from Russia and USA, lesser Canada and New Zealand
3. Cumulatively, southeast Asian countries rival Russia (43, 621)

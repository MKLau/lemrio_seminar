- Human impacts on landscapes, diversity and geo-physical processes
  have reached planetary scales to such a degree that current
  conditions are forming a distinct epoch in Earth's geological
  history referred to as the Anthropocene.
- In the Anthropocene forests ecosystems, which are important
  resevoirs of biodiversity that perform services integral to global
  human health, are being increasingly impacted by the indirect
  effects of economic trade as well as climate change.
- Given the increased potential for ecological distrubances under
  climate change, it is important to study forest landscapes, which
  are coupled to humans through globalized supply chains, from a
  systems perspective.
- In my talk, I will give an introduction to how recently developed
  environmentally extended economic models that quantify the indirect
  effects of land use are being studied using network analysis and in
  particular the trade of landscapes that are "embodied" in trade.
- I will then present results of recent and on-going work that focuses
  on the structure of China's embodied forest networks, concluding
  with a discussion of the potential implications for their response
  to future disturbances.
